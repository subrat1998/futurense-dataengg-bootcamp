Problem Statement 1:
Some complaints have been lodged by patients that they have been prescribed hospital-exclusive medicine that they canâ€™t find elsewhere and 
facing problems due to that. Joshua, from the pharmacy management, wants to get a report of which pharmacies have prescribed hospital-exclusive 
medicines the most in the years 2021 and 2022. Assist Joshua to generate the report so that the pharmacies who prescribe hospital-exclusive medicine
more often are advised to avoid such practice if possible.
